Key Features
1. Networking
The project utilizes TCP/IP networking concepts for communication between the server and client. This ensures reliable data transfer and connection establishment.

2. Multithreading
The server employs multithreading to handle multiple client connections simultaneously. This enhances the scalability and responsiveness of the tool.

3. Subprocess Library
The subprocess library is used for installing required Python packages on the client side. It dynamically checks for and installs missing dependencies, ensuring a seamless user experience.

4. GUI Interface
The client side features a user-friendly GUI built with tkinter. Users can input their Instagram credentials and initiate the follower ratio check with a single click.

5. Security Considerations
   
-Educational Demonstration
  This tool includes a demonstration of a potential security vulnerability for educational purposes only. The storage of user credentials in a plaintext file (credentials.txt) on the server side is intentionally   implemented to highlight the risks associated with such practices.

-Responsible Disclosure
  If you discover security vulnerabilities or weaknesses during your exploration, it is highly encouraged to follow responsible disclosure practices. Report your findings to the relevant parties, such as the       developers or maintainers of the software, to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to address and rectify any identified issues.

-Ethical Use Disclaimer
  This tool should only be used in controlled environments, and users are explicitly advised not to deploy it in real-world scenarios or use it for malicious purposes. The documentation emphasizes the importance   of ethical use and compliance with legal standards.

-Educational Resources
  For users interested in learning more about secure coding practices and avoiding common security pitfalls, the documentation can provide links to educational resources on secure coding, ethical hacking, and   cybersecurity best practices.

  By taking these steps, you can ensure that your efforts contribute positively to the security community and help foster a better understanding of secure development practices.
